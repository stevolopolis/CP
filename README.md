# Coordinate Permutation Is All You Need

## Structure of the repo

## Questions seeking answers
- Coordinate permutation (CP) perspective in one resolution (observed; not proved yet)
- How do we prove that NGP is doing CP instead of embedding learning? Or, is embedding learning = CP? We need a rigorous definition and explanation
- CP when concatenated in multiple resolutions
- CP on other hybrid methods
- CP with or without hashing
- CP in 3D or higher dimensions
- CP param to expressivity trade-off (rigorous math)
- Is hash embedding learning permuted coordinates or saving multi-resolution pixel values
- Deformable NGP grid
- CP as a constructive method of INRs
    - Can expand a whole topic hereâ€¦
